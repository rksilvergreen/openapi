I would like to make major changes to the way this project works.
The way it is currently intended to works is in 3 stages:

1.validate - make sure that the yaml input is valid
2.parse - create a Dart tree from the yaml input
3.analyze (not yet implemented) - use the created Dart tree and create some sort of analysis that would later on be used by the openapi_dart_generator.

I want it to be different:
1.structural validation.
2.parse - create a Dart tree from the yaml input.
3.semantic validation.
4.schema modeling - creating more specific models of schemas and operations. This is what will be imported by the generator, to be used for code generation.

The difference between structural validation and semantic validation is explained in openapi_validation.md.

we are still focusing on creating this for version openapi 3.0.0 in folder v3_0_0. we will work later on doing the same for later versions.
Every stage should have its own folder so change the folder names and create new ones if needed.

What I want you to do now is this: separate the validation logic we have already implemented into the two different types of validation.
openapi_validation.md gives a good explanation on the differences between the two. A lot of the examples in the file are things we have already implemented. Do not start creating new validation rules, or removing rules, for either stage.
the idea is just to separate them into different stages. Later on if we see a rule we should add/remove, we will do it. not for now.
The structural validation is done before, as we have said.
Then the parsing stage, which is already been implemented (tweek if needed).
Then the semantic validation is done using the Dart tree from the parsing stage.
Leave aside the schema modeling stage for now. do not implement it yet. There is some content in the 'modeler' folder currently. Ignore it.
