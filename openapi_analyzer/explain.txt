There will be validation exception errors throughout the project.

Schema validation:

Validation Error Types and Severity Levels
Severity Levels
Three severity levels:
critical: Schema represents an empty set (no valid instances possible)
Example: {type: string, minLength: 10, maxLength: 5} — impossible to satisfy
Always causes validation to fail regardless of strictness level
moderate: Schema allows only trivial instances (empty array or empty object)
Example: Array schema with incompatible items where minItems is not set, allowing empty arrays as the only valid instance
Causes validation to fail in strict and moderate modes
low: Not recommended schema patterns that might cause confusing code generation or indicate poor API design, but don't make the schema technically invalid
Causes validation to fail only in strict mode
Error Categories by Severity
Critical Severity Errors (Always fail validation)
Type Compatibility:
Incompatible explicit types across schemas (e.g., string and number simultaneously)
Explicit type doesn't match properties-suggested type
Properties from multiple types in a schema without explicit type
Different inferred types across schemas without explicit types
Constraint Conflicts:
Numeric constraints: minimum > maximum, or exclusiveMinimum >= exclusiveMaximum
String constraints: minLength > maxLength
Array constraints: minItems > maxItems
Object constraints: minProperties > maxProperties
Conflicting uniqueItems constraints (some require unique, others allow duplicates)
Reference Issues:
Circular reference detected
Reference not found in document
Duplicate references in composition arrays (oneOf/anyOf/allOf)
Value Constraints:
Multiple different const values (schema can never be satisfied)
Enum constraints with no common values (schema can never be satisfied)
Default value not in enum values
Path Issues:
Duplicate templated paths (e.g., /users/{id} vs /users/{userId})
Low Severity Errors (Fail only in strict mode)
Type Declaration Issues:
Schema missing explicit "type" property (type will be inferred)
Empty schema (no explicit type and no type-specific properties)
Property-Type Mismatches:
Schema has explicit type but contains properties from other types:
String type with number/integer properties
String type with array properties
String type with object properties
Number/integer type with string properties
Number/integer type with array properties
Number/integer type with object properties
Array type with string properties
Array type with number/integer properties
Array type with object properties
Object type with string properties
Object type with number/integer properties
Object type with array properties
Boolean type with any other type's properties
Strictness Levels
Controls which severity levels cause validation to fail:
strict: All severities (critical, moderate, low) cause validation to fail
moderate: Only critical and moderate severities fail validation; low severity issues are printed as warnings
permissive: Only critical severity issues fail validation; moderate and low severity issues are printed as warnings
Summary
Critical errors = Schema is invalid (empty set, impossible constraints)
Moderate errors = Schema only allows trivial instances (empty arrays/objects)
Low errors = Schema is technically valid but not recommended (missing types, property mismatches)
The validation system collects exceptions during validation and processes them at the end based on the strictness level, allowing validation to continue and find all issues rather than stopping at the first error.
